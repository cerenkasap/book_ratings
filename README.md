# Predict Book Ratings ðŸ“š: Project Overview

Created a tool that can estimate the book ratings **(Mean Absolute Error - 0.21)** to help bibliophiles to predict the average book ratings when it comes to pick next book to read.

Pulled over **11123 books** from Kaggle using pandas and opendatasets libraries in python.

Applied **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regression** and optimized using **RandomGridSearchCV** to find the best model.

Built a client facing API using **flask.**

### Code Used

Python version: *Python 3.7.11* 

Packages: *pandas, opendatasets, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, nltk, wordcloud, pickle, flask, json*

For Web Framework Requirements: *pip install -r requirements.txt*

## Data Collection
Used Kaggle to pull the datasets 11123 books with 12 columns:
* bookID              
* title                
* authors             
* average_rating      
* isbn                
* isbn13              
* language_code      
* num_pages         
* ratings_count      
* text_reviews_count  
* publication_date    
* publisher 


## Data Cleaning

After pulling the data, I cleaned up the dataset to be ready to use for the model. The changes were made follows:

* Pulled years from publication_date column and created publication_year column.
* Calculated age of each book by substracting the publication year by 2022 (current year we are in).
* Dropped isbn column since we have isbn13 column.
* Changed language codes with their full name and merged English based ones (e.g. en-ca, en-us etc.) to English.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized the cleaned data to see the trends and correlation between attributes and check if there is any outliers.

* Created *Bar graphs, Box plots, Scatter plot, and Heat map * for **numerical** variables.

* Created *Pie Chart and WordCloud* for **categorical** variables.

## Model Building

Categorical variables were transformed: 
* **language** variable transformed to a dummy variable.
* **authors, title, and publisher** variables were encoded.

Data were split into **train (80%)** and **test (20%)** sets.

I used two models *(Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression)* to predict book ratings and evaluated them by using *MAE (Mean Absolute Error)*.

## Model Performance Evalution
Random Forest Regression model performed better than Linear Regression model in this project.

|Linear Regression |Train  |Test |                      
| -------------    |:-----:| ---:|                      
|MSE               |0.122  |0.098|
|R^2               |0.042  |0.008|
|MAE               |0.228  |0.223|
|RMSE              |0.350  |0.313|

|Random Forest Regression |Train  |Test  |
| -------------           |:-----:| ----:|
|MSE                      |0.014  |0.101 |
|R^2                      |0.888  |-0.019|
|MAE                      |0.079  |0.210 |
|RMSE                     |0.120  |0.318 |


## Productionization
The flask API endpoint was built and hosted on a local server (web), it takes in a request and predicts a book rating. 

### Notes
My model was over than 100 MB which GitHub doesn't support any file over than 100MB. 
I tried [this method](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70765999) and it worked for me, attaching for future reference.

Thanks :)
